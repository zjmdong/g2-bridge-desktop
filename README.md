# G2 Bridge

Stream your Windows or Mac desktop to DJI Goggles 2 or DJI Goggles Integra over USB. The goggles use Virtual Flight mode with stock firmware. The simulator and controller run on the computer.

## DJI Goggles Streamer desktop client

This fork adds **DJI Goggles Streamer 0.0.1**, a Windows x64 graphical client.
It wraps the unchanged SDK with environment and firmware checks, integrated
driver setup, streaming controls, persistent settings and offline help.
The first version streams the SDK's default desktop at 1080p using NVIDIA NVENC;
window selection, an independent extended desktop and a macOS GUI are planned.

See the [Windows user and build guide](docs/desktop/USER_GUIDE.md),
[validation record](docs/desktop/VALIDATION.md) and
[third-party notices](docs/desktop/THIRD_PARTY.md). The command-line SDK described
below remains available unchanged. Upstream latency measurements below describe
the SDK's original hardware tests, not a new measurement of the desktop client.

The bridge detects the model when it connects:

| Goggles | Identity | Tested firmware |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DJI Goggles 2 | `E3T ZV900` | 01.11.00.00, 01.14.00.00 |
| DJI Goggles Integra | `E3T ZV901` | 01.09.00.00 |

We measured **about 12 ms median monitor-to-lens delay** at 1080p100. See [how we measured it](docs/LATENCY.md).

## Requirements

On Windows, you need the following hardware and software:

- 64-bit Windows and Python 3.10 or later.
- An NVIDIA GPU with NVENC support.
- FFmpeg with `gfxcapture` and `h264_nvenc`. To install it, run `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`.
- [DJI Assistant 2 (Consumer Drones Series)](https://www.dji.com/downloads/softwares/dji-assistant-2-consumer-drones-series), which installs the DJI USB driver 5.0.0.7. See [USB and driver requirements](docs/PROTOCOL.md#usb-and-session).

Tests used FFmpeg build `2026-11-05-git-0893feba65` and NVIDIA driver 610.74.

On macOS, you need the following:

- macOS and Python 3.10 or later.
- Apple's command-line developer tools, which build the screen capture helper on the first run.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), for libusb. Before macOS 12.3, the bridge also needs FFmpeg.
- A USB-A-to-USB-C cable. If the Mac has only USB-C ports, add a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter. Over a USB-C-to-USB-C cable, the goggles take the USB host role and the Mac can't detect them.

The stream script offers to install whatever is missing. Tests used an M2 Pro MacBook Pro with macOS 27.0, Swift 6.4.2, and Homebrew FFmpeg 8.1.1.

## Start streaming

1. Power on the goggles, connect a USB data cable, and open **More > DJI Virtual Flight**. On a Mac, when macOS asks whether the accessory can connect, select **Allow**.
2. From the repository root, install the Python dependencies.

   On Windows, run:

   ```powershell
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   On macOS, run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the stream.

   On Windows, run:

   ```powershell
   python scripts/stream_desktop.py
   ```

   On macOS, run:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/stream_desktop.py
   ```

   On Windows, the script finds the DJI driver and FFmpeg automatically. If either is installed somewhere else, pass `--dll` or `--ffmpeg` with the file path.

   On a Mac, the script offers to install anything that's missing, and it builds the screen capture helper on the first run. If the screen can't be captured, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and allow screen recording for your terminal.

The default output is **1920x1080** at a **100 fps encoder target**. Windows uses **32 Mbps**, or automatically selects **24 Mbps at 60 fps** and **30 Mbps at 75 fps**. macOS uses **20 Mbps**. To stop streaming, press **Ctrl+C**. The bridge writes logs to `work/logs/`.

Use these options to adjust the stream:

| Option | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `--fps` | `60`, `75`, `90`, `100` |
| `--bitrate-mbps` | `8`, `10`, `12`, `16`, `20`, `24`. On Windows, also `30`, `32`, and `40` |
| `--display` | Monitor index, starting at `0` |
| `--hide-cursor` | Hide the mouse pointer |
| `--capture` | Windows: `gfxcapture` or `ddagrab`. macOS: `screencapturekit` or `avfoundation` |

Run `python scripts/stream_desktop.py --help` for all options.

For example, use `python scripts/stream_desktop.py --fps 90` to target 90 fps.
These values set the stream rate, not the goggles' panel refresh rate. Lower
rates provide more bits per frame at the same bitrate, but increase the time
between frames. The 100 fps target has the shortest frame interval.

Windows encoding uses gradual refresh to reduce periodic compression blur.
For details, see the [quality measurements and reproduction steps](docs/research/WINDOWS_QUALITY.md).

## Run tests

Run the tests from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
